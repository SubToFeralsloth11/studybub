        "Strength: the tribute system allowed the Aztecs to extract vast wealth from conquered peoples without having to directly govern them — it was an efficient way to run an empire. Weakness: because conquered peoples were not integrated into Aztec society and resented paying tribute, they had no loyalty to the empire. When Cortés arrived, many tribute-paying groups saw an opportunity to overthrow their Aztec overlords and allied with the Spanish. The system that made the empire rich also made it fragile.",
