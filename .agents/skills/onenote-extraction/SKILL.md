# OneNote → StudyBub Content Generation

Extract curriculum structure and topic exemplars from OneNote Class Notebooks,
then use them as a seed to generate comprehensive StudyBub content. Never copy
OneNote content verbatim — the notebook is a blueprint that tells you what
topics to teach, at what difficulty, and in what sequence. You must expand each
topic into thorough learnCards, varied practice questions, and mastery checks
that exercise every dimension of the content area.

The content model contract is at `src/contracts/contentModel.md`.

## Quick start

```bash
# 0. Check if extraction already exists (skip to step 3 if so)
ls /tmp/onenote-extraction/extracted.json 2>/dev/null && echo "Already extracted — skip to step 3"

# 1. Login (once per session) — see references/login.md for SSO quirks
agent-browser open https://onenote.cloud.microsoft/notebooks --session-name onenote
# … complete the login flow …

# 2. Extract pages
bun run .agents/skills/onenote-extraction/scripts/extractPages.ts
# Output: /tmp/onenote-extraction/extracted.json + image PNGs

# 3. Generate comprehensive StudyBub content (see Expansion workflow below)
# Output: src/content/tracks/<trackName>.ts files
```

## Extraction approach

### Playwright DOM scraping

No Azure AD app required. Works with existing 1Password credentials and
agent-browser session. Extracts rendered text + images from the WOPI iframe.

**When to use:** Quick extraction, no Azure portal access, only need curriculum
structure and topic exemplars (not verbatim content).

**Script:** `scripts/extractPages.ts`

**Limitations:** Extracts text as plain strings (no maths notation preserved,
no question-type detection). Images extracted as PNGs to `/tmp/onenote-extraction/`.
Content limited to what OneNote Online renders in the browser. This is fine —
we do not need perfect extraction because we are generating new content, not
copying.

**What it typically captures from a well-organised Class Notebook:**
- **Curriculum-plan pages** (e.g. "Term 1", "Term 2"): week-by-week topic lists
  with textbook exercise references. These provide the track/lesson structure.
- **Exercise-table pages** (e.g. "Questions"): exercise numbers organised by
  difficulty columns (Fluency, Problem Solving, Enrichment). These tell you the
  scope and difficulty gradient.
- **Empty template pages** (e.g. "Class Notes", "Handouts", "Homework",
  "Quizzes"): navigation chrome only — no real content. Skip these.
- **Planner images** (e.g. the Term Maths Planner): screenshots of the
  curriculum overview. Useful as reference but not as lesson content.

The actual teaching content (explanations, worked examples, question text) is
rarely in OneNote — it is typically in the textbook the exercises reference.
This is why we use OneNote as a blueprint, not a content source.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Login to OneNote

Use agent-browser with the QLD Education SSO credentials from 1Password.
See `references/login.md` for the exact eval commands and SSO quirks.

The session file at `~/.agent-browser/sessions/onenote-default.json` is
Playwright-compatible (standard `storageState` format).

### Step 2: Extract pages

`extractPages.ts` (bundled at `scripts/extractPages.ts`) does the following:

1. Loads the agent-browser session into Playwright
2. Opens the Class Notebook URL (SharePoint `doc.aspx`)
3. Waits for the WOPI iframe (`officeapps.live.com`) to load
4. Discovers sections via `[role="navigation"] [role="tree"]`
5. Clicks each section, then each page within the section
6. Extracts page text from the WOPI frame's DOM
7. Extracts images, saving them as PNGs and recording metadata
8. Deduplicates images that appear on multiple pages (WOPI UI chrome)
9. Writes `extracted.json` to `/tmp/onenote-extraction/`

**Configuration in the script:**
- `NOTEBOOK_URL` — the SharePoint doc.aspx URL for the Class Notebook
- `SECTIONS` — hardcoded list of section names to extract (dynamic detection is unstable)
- Image size threshold: `naturalWidth > 60 && naturalHeight > 60`
- Data URI minimum size: 500 bytes (filters UI sprites)

### Step 3: Clean extracted text

The raw page text includes OneNote navigation chrome that must be stripped:

- Header block: "2026 - Year 8 Maths … File Home Insert … Share …"
- "Conflicting change." notifications
- "Add section" / "Add page" UI labels
- Section tree listings repeated in page content

Use the regex patterns in `extractPages.ts` (`getPageContent` function) or
apply a post-processing pass with similar patterns.

**Pages to skip:**

- Pages with < 100 chars of cleaned content (empty templates).
- Duplicate sections: the student section (e.g. "GRIMES, Thomas") often mirrors
  the Content Library. Prefer the Content Library version.
- Non-subject pages (e.g. "Connect" pages with wellbeing factsheets).
- The "Welcome" section — its pages are almost always empty templates.

### Step 4: Generate comprehensive content (the expansion step)

This is the core step. **Do not convert OneNote content verbatim.** The
notebook tells you what topics to teach and at what difficulty — you must
generate fresh, comprehensive content that thoroughly covers each topic.

Use the curriculum-plan pages as your blueprint. Each topic line (e.g.
"1E/1F Adding and subtracting negative integers") becomes a lesson. But
instead of extracting whatever sparse text might exist on that OneNote page,
you must author full lesson content from scratch.

**Do not write a separate generation script.** Create the track files directly
in `src/content/tracks/` following the content model contract.

#### Pre-generation inventory (always do first)

Before writing any content, inventory the extracted pages:

1. Read the extracted JSON and list every page with its cleaned content.
2. Classify each page:
   - **curriculum-plan** — contains "Week N" headings and topic lines with
     exercise numbers (e.g. "1E/1F Adding and subtracting negative integers").
   - **exercise-table** — tab-separated exercise numbers in Fluency / Problem
     Solving / Enrichment columns.
   - **empty-template** — < 100 chars of cleaned content; skip.
   - **non-maths** — wellbeing factsheets, admin pages; skip.
3. Read all existing `src/content/tracks/*.ts` files and note which topics are
   already covered.
4. Cross-reference the curriculum-plan topics against existing tracks.
5. Identify uncovered topics and decide how to group them into new tracks.

#### Content expansion principles

For every topic you generate content for, follow these rules:

1. **Never copy OneNote text verbatim.** Use it only to understand the topic
   scope, difficulty level, and exercise structure.
2. **Author at least 3 learnCards per lesson.** Include: (a) a key idea card
   with conceptual explanation, (b) a worked example with step-by-step
   solution, and (c) a common-mistake or extension card.
3. **Author at least 8 practice questions per lesson.** Spread them across:
   - 3–4 fluency/drill questions (straightforward, build confidence).
   - 2–3 problem-solving questions (multi-step, apply concepts).
   - 1–2 enrichment/extension questions (non-routine, deepen understanding).
4. **Author at least 3 mastery questions per lesson.** Each should test a
   different aspect of the topic so a pass means genuine competence, not
   memorisation of one pattern.
5. **Vary question types.** Use numeric, expression, mcq, shortText,
   fillInTheBlank, and matching types across the lesson. Do not default to
   all numeric. At least 40% of questions should be non-numeric types.
6. **Every question must have a thorough explanation.** Show the reasoning, not
   just the answer. The explanation is what the learner sees on wrong answers.
7. **Write real questions, never placeholders.** The `accepted` array must
   contain correct answers. Placeholder questions (with sentinel values like
   "(answer to be filled)") are not acceptable — every question must be fully
   answerable.

#### Topic-to-track grouping

Do not create one track per OneNote section. Group related topics into
sensible tracks based on subject area:

| Topics | Suggested track id |
|--------|-------------------|
| 1E/1F, 1G, 1H (negative integers, order of operations) | `integer-operations` |
| 4A, 4B, 4C, 4E, 4F (perimeter, circumference, area) | `perimeter-and-area` |
| 4K, 4L, 4M (Pythagoras) | `pythagoras` |
| 4H, 4I (volume, capacity) | `volume` |
| 3F (decimals) | `decimals` |
| 2D (quadrilaterals) | `quadrilaterals` |
| 10D, 10E, 10H, 10I (congruency, similarity) | `geometry` |

#### Using the exercise-table as a difficulty guide

The exercise-table pages show question numbers organised by difficulty columns
(Fluency, Problem Solving, Enrichment). Use this to calibrate your generated
questions:

- **Fluency column** → your simplest practice questions. Single-step,
  straightforward application of the concept. 10–15 XP each.
- **Problem Solving column** → your intermediate practice questions.
  Multi-step, requires connecting ideas. 15–20 XP each.
- **Enrichment column** → your hardest practice questions and some mastery
  questions. Non-routine, deep thinking required. 20–25 XP each.

The number of exercise references in each column tells you the approximate
ratio of difficulty levels to generate.

#### Structural mapping

| OneNote concept | StudyBub type | How to use it |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Notebook (e.g. "2026 - Year 8 Maths") | Subject | One Subject per notebook |
| Section (e.g. "Term 1") | Content grouping | Groups topics by term; topics within a term share a curriculum phase |
| Curriculum-plan topic line | Lesson | One lesson per topic; use exercise number as title prefix |
| Exercise-table row | Difficulty guide | Calibrate question count and difficulty per lesson |
| Embedded image in page | Figure | Copy PNG to `public/figures/`, reference by filename stem |

#### Lesson structure

Each topic line from a curriculum-plan page generates a Lesson. Parse lines
like `1E/1F Adding and subtracting negative integers` into:

```typescript
{
  id: "int-1e-adding-subtracting",   // track-prefix + exercise + short-slug
  order: 1,                            // Contiguous within track
  title: "1E/1F Adding and subtracting negative integers",
  sourceRef: "1E/1F",
  aiProvenance: {
    tool: "Claude",
    sources: ["2026 - Year 8 Maths Class Notebook"],
    role: "generated",
  },
  learnCards: [
    // At least 3: key idea, worked example, common-mistake/extension
  ],
  practice: [
    // At least 8: mix of fluency, problem-solving, enrichment
  ],
  mastery: [
    // At least 3: each tests a different aspect
  ],
}
```

The `sourceRef` field should reference the originating worksheet or textbook
reference, not the OneNote page name. For the planner-context source, use the
notebook title and the term/week the topic appears in.

#### BossChallenge generation

Create a synthetic BossChallenge for each track that draws on the hardest
concepts from across the track's lessons. Use the exercise-table enrichment
column to identify the most challenging topics. Format:

- 2 questions of medium difficulty (20 XP each).
- 2 questions of high difficulty (25 XP each).
- 1 conceptual/multiple-choice question (20 XP).

The `sourceRef` should reference the curriculum planner (e.g.
"2026 T1 Yr 8 Maths Planner — Term 1, Week 2").

#### Year-level corrections

The OneNote shows what year level each topic is taught in this class. If
existing tracks have incorrect year labels (e.g. geometry marked "Year 10"
but the OneNote teaches it in Year 8), correct them during this workflow.

#### Integration checklist (after creating content)

After creating new track files, complete these steps:

1. **Add badges** — add a `track-complete:<id>` and `boss-pass:<id>` badge
   to `src/content/badges.ts` for each new track.
2. **Wire imports** — import each new track in `src/content/index.ts` and add
   it to the `tracks` array.
3. **Run validation** — execute `validateContent(appContent)` and confirm zero
   issues.
4. **Check references** — verify every `subjectId`, `passBadgeId`, and badge
   `criterion` resolves to a real entity.
5. **Fix existing labels** — if the notebook shows existing tracks have wrong
   year labels, correct them now.
6. **TypeScript check** — run `npx tsc --noEmit` to confirm no type errors.

#### Content file template

Each track file in `src/content/tracks/` should follow this pattern:

```typescript
/**
 * TrackName track content (Year 8, chapter X).
 *
 * Covers ... — based on the 2026 Year 8 Maths Class Notebook
 * curriculum plan (Term N, Week M).
 *
 * @author John Grimes
 * @module content/tracks/trackName
 */

import { m, t } from "../blocks";
import type { Lesson, Track, Question } from "../../domain/content/types";

// Lesson definitions as exported consts...
// Challenge questions array...

/** The TrackName track. */
export const trackNameTrack: Track = {
  id: "track-name",
  subjectId: "maths",
  title: "Track Name (Year 8)",
  description: "Short description.",
  lessons: [...],
  challenge: {
    id: "track-name-boss",
    title: "Boss challenge: Track name",
    sourceRef: "2026 TN Yr 8 Maths Planner — Term N, Week M",
    questions: challengeQuestions,
    bonusXp: 120,
    passBadgeId: "boss-track-name",
    aiProvenance: {
      tool: "Claude",
      sources: ["2026 - Year 8 Maths Class Notebook"],
      role: "generated",
    },
  },
};
```

## Image extraction notes

- Images are WOPI-rendered content inside the WOPI iframe.
- Blob URLs and data URLs are resolved within the frame context.
- Regular URL images are fetched via Playwright's request API.
- SVG images are filtered out (they are WOPI UI elements, not content).
- Cross-page deduplication removes UI chrome that appears on every page.
- Output: PNG files in `/tmp/onenote-extraction/` named `{section}__{page}__img{NNN}.png`.

## Key constraints and limitations

### WOPI iframe isolation
The WOPI frame (`officeapps.live.com`) is cross-origin from the parent
SharePoint page. `agent-browser snapshot` cannot see inside it. Use
Playwright's `page.frames()` to access the iframe directly.

### Read-only mode
Class Notebooks open in read-only mode (`edit=0`). The File backstage ("File"
tab) does not expose Export, Save As, or Download options. Text extraction must
be done via DOM scraping.

### Dynamic section tree
The section tree structure changes after clicking sections (collapsed sections
expand). Use hardcoded section names from a prior manual inspection rather than
dynamic discovery for reliability.

### Curriculum-plan page structure

The most valuable pages for content generation are the curriculum-plan pages
(e.g. "Term 1", "Term 2"). Their structure is predictable:

- A "Week N" heading.
- Topic lines under each week: exercise number, then topic name.
- Extension topics marked with "EXTENSION" prefix.

Example from a cleaned page:
```
Week 2
1E/1F Adding and subtracting negative integers
1G Multiplying and dividing negative numbers
1H Order of Operations and Substitution
EXTENSION 3C Operations with negative fractions
Week 3
4A Length and perimeter
4B Circumference of a circle
```

Parse these to build the track lesson list. Each topic line becomes a lesson.
Group consecutive weeks that cover related topics into the same track.

### IRM encryption
`.one` files downloaded from SharePoint are encrypted at rest by Information
Rights Management (IRM). Do not attempt to parse `.one` files directly.
